Master gives the clue.
After switching back to PLAYER mode, players get their turn.
As the players selects the words, if it changes to their team’s color, they can proceed with their selection.
If they select either COMMON WORDS or the opposite team’s words, then the team’s turn is automatically ended.
The opposite team starts their turn.
If a team guesses all words from master’s clue or if they want to play safer by guessing few words, players can manually end their turn by clicking “END TURN”. 
When any player chooses the GAME BUSTER WORD, the the game ends and the opposite team wins!
Hence master’s clue should never be associated with GAME BUSTER WORD
The first team who guess all the words of their team wins!!
